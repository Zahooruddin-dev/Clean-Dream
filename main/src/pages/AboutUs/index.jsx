        <p className="text col-md">
          Working over 10 years in the business of home care and cleaning
          service, our founder and proud mother of 3, Maria Garzon wanted to
          expand both her knowledge of the industry onto others just like her as
          well as bring her years of expertise in the form of peace and joy into
          the homes of many she could not reach before as a freelance
          housecleaner. Beginning as a solo business as a way to support her
          children she now embraces her first years of experience and uses these
          lessons to teach and train her extraordinary staff. Utilizing the
          support of her staff and children she attempts to satisfy every client
          that comes to her in need and hopes for you to be the next approaching
          client.
